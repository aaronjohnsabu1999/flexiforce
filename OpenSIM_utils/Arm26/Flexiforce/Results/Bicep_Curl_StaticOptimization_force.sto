This file contains the forces exerted on a model during a simulation.

A force is a generalized force, meaning that it can be either a force (N) or a torque (Nm).

Units are S.I. units (second, meters, Newtons, ...)
If the header above contains a line with 'inDegrees', this indicates whether rotational values are in degrees (yes) or radians (no).
